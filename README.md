## Usage

#### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
conda create -n DP-LET python=3.8
conda activate DP-LET
```
##### ðŸ’¡Hint:
If you don't have Miniconda or Anaconda installed, please download it from: https://www.anaconda.com/download

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
cd framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### ðŸ’¡Hint:
We used a Quadro RTX 5000 GPU for training, with CUDA version 11.4.
If you wish to use a different version, please refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/ to download the appropriate version of PyTorch for your CUDA environment.

#### 3. Prepare the dataset

Download the [Call Detail Records Dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EGZHFV)

You can choose any desired time duration and number of cells, and save the file as:
```
framework/data/MILAN/Milan_Internet_[cell_number]_10min.csv
```
For example:
```
framework/data/MILAN/Milan_Internet_100_10min.csv
```

#### 4. Run the training script
```bash
python run.py
```
